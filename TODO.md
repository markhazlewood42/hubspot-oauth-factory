- Make this work with a single app OAuth install
  - Deploy it to Vercel to verify, hardcode single app credentials as environment vars
- Update database to create a table of apps, and map installs to apps
- Update OAuth flow and all management / token access to key on app ID ==> Make all of this app ID agnostic
- Provide a UI to register an app in the database
  - Need app ID, client ID, client secret, scopes
- Once app is registered, provide user with redirect URL and install URL
